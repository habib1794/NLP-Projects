       "\"Introduction\\n\\nIndia has emerged as the fastest growing major economy in the world and is expected to be one of the top three economic powers in the world over the next 10-15 years, backed by its robust democracy and strong partnerships.\\n\\nMarket size\\n\\nIndia's gross domestic product (GDP) (at constant 2011-12 prices) was estimated to be Rs 145.65 lakh crore (US$ 2.06 trillion) for 2019-20, growing 4.2 per cent over the previous year.\\n\\nIndia retained its position as the third largest start-up base in the world with over 8,900-9,300 start-ups as 1,300 new start-ups got incorporated in 2019 according to a report by NASSCOM. India also witnessed the addition of 7 unicorns in 2019 (till August 2019), taking the total tally to 24.\\n\\nIndia's labour force is expected to touch 160-170 million by 2020 based on the rate of population growth, increased labour force participation and higher education enrolment among other factors according to a study by ASSOCHAM and Thought Arbitrage Research Institute.\\n\\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves reached Rs 37.31 lakh crore (US$ 493.48 billion) in the week up to May 29, 2020 according to the data from RBI.\\n\\nRecent Developments                                                                                         \\n\\nWith an improvement in the economic scenario, there have been investments across various sectors of the economy. The mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in India stood at US$ 28 billion in 2019, while private equity (PE) deals reached US$ 48 billion. Some of the important recent developments in Indian economy are as follows:\\n\\nMerchandise export and import (in US$ terms) declined by 4.8 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively, in 2019-20.\\nNikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 30.8 in May 2020, showing contraction in the sector because of coronavirus-related restrictions.\\nGross tax revenue stood at Rs 15.04 lakh crore (US$ 215.28 billion) in 2019-20 – income tax collection contributed Rs 4.80 lakh crore (US$ 68.14 billion) to it..\\nIn 2019, companies in India raised around US$ 2.5 billion through 17 initial public offers (IPO).\\nIndia's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) equity inflow reached US$ 469.99 billion between April 2000 to March 2020, with maximum contribution from services, computer software and hardware, telecommunications, construction, trading, and automobiles.\\nIndia’s Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for 2019-20 stood at 129.2.\\nThe combined index of eight core industries stood at 137 in March 2020. Its cumulative growth was 0.6 per cent in 2019-20.\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) – Combined inflation was 5.9 per cent in March 2020 as compared to 6.6 per cent in February 2020. The annual consumer price inflation increased to 4.8 per cent in 2019-20 from 3.4 per cent in 2018-19.\\nAround 12 million jobs in a year were created in India during 2015-19.\\nIndia improved its ranking in World Bank's Doing Business Report by 14 spots over last year and was ranked 63 among 190 countries in the 2020 edition of the report.\\nIndia is expected to have 100,000 start-ups by 2025, which will create employment for 3.25 million people and generate US$ 500 billion in value as per Mr T V Mohan Das Pai, Chairman, Manipal Global Education.\\nGovernment Initiatives\\n\\nThe first Union Budget of the third decade of 21st century was presented by Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Ms Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament on February 1, 2020.  The budget aimed at energising the Indian economy through a combination of short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures.\\n\\nTotal expenditure for 2020-21 is budgeted at Rs 37.14 lakh crore (US$ 531.53 billion), an increase of 13 per cent from 2019-20 (revised budget estimates).\\n\\nNumerous foreign companies are setting up their facilities in India on account of various Government initiatives like Make in India and Digital India. Mr Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, launched Make in India initiative with an aim to boost country’s manufacturing sector and increase purchasing power of an average Indian consumer, which would further drive demand and spur development, thus benefiting investors. The Government of India, under its Make in India initiative, is trying to boost the contribution made by the manufacturing sector with an aims to take it to 25 per cent of the GDP from the current 17 per cent. Besides, the Government has also come up with Digital India initiative, which focuses on three core components: creation of digital infrastructure, delivering services digitally and to increase the digital literacy.\\n\\nSome of the recent initiatives and developments undertaken by the Government are listed below:\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi announced various economic packages, having a cumulative worth of around Rs 20 lakh crore (US$ 283.73 billion) and being almost 10 per cent of India's GDP.\\nPradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGK) was introduced in April 2020 to provide relief to underprivileged and help them fight the battle against COVID-19. The budget allocated to the scheme was Rs 1.70 lakh crore (US$ 24.12 billion).\\nIndia is expected to attract investment of around US$ 100 billion in developing the oil and gas infrastructure during 2019-23.\\nThe Government of India is going to increase public health spending to 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2025.\\nFor implementation of Agriculture Export Policy, Government approved an outlay Rs 206.8 crore (US$ 29.59 million) for 2019, aimed at doubling farmers income by 2022.\\nUnder the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), Government has sanctioned more than 96.50 lakh houses under PMAY(U) and approved 606 proposals for the construction of 3,31,075 houses with an overall investment of Rs 15,125 crore (US$ 2.16 billion).\\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved to increase the authorized capital of Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the existing Rs 3,500 crore (US$ 500.79 million) to Rs 10,000 crore (US$ 1.43 billion).\\nIndia has registered a 26.9 per cent reduction in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) since 2013: Sample Registration System Bulletin-2016.\\nAround 26.02 million households were electrified by 31st March 2019 under Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA).  \\nIn the mid-term review of Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry enhanced the scope of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS), increased MEIS incentive for ready-made garments and made-ups by 2 per cent, SEIS incentive by 2 per cent and increased the validity of Duty Credit Scrips from 18 months to 24 months. In April 2020, Government extended FTP for one more year (up to March 31, 2021).\\n \\nRoad Ahead\\n\\nIndia's GDP is expected to reach US$ 5 trillion by FY25 and achieve upper-middle income status on the back of digitization, globalization, favorable demographics, and reforms.\\n\\nIndia is also focusing on renewable sources to generate energy. It is planning to achieve 40 per cent of its energy from non-fossil sources by 2030, which is currently 30 per cent, and have plans to increase its renewable energy capacity from to 175 gigawatt (GW) by 2022.\\n\\nIndia is expected to be the third largest consumer economy as its consumption may triple to US$ 4 trillion by 2025, owing to shift in consumer behavior and expenditure pattern, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. It is estimated to surpass USA to become the second largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) by 2040 as per a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\n\\nThe Indian healthcare scenario presents a spectrum of contrasting landscapes. At one end of the spectrum are the glitzy steel and glass structures delivering high tech medicare to the well-heeled, mostly urban Indian. At the other end are the ramshackle outposts in the remote reaches of the “other India” trying desperately to live up to their identity as health subcenters, waiting to be transformed to shrines of health and wellness, a story which we will wait to see unfold. With the rapid pace of change currently being witnessed, this spectrum is likely to widen further, presenting even more complexity in the future.\\n\\nOur country began with a glorious tradition of public health, as seen in the references to the descriptions of the Indus valley civilization (5500–1300 BCE) which mention “Arogya” as reflecting “holistic well-being.”[1] The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien (tr.AD 399–414) takes this further, commenting on the excellent facilities for curative care at the time.[2] Today, we are a country of 1,296,667,068 people (estimated as of this writing) who present an enormous diversity, and therefore, an enormous challenge to the healthcare delivery system.[3] This brings into sharp focus the WHO theme of 2018, which calls for “Universal Health Coverage-Everyone, Everywhere.”\\n\\nWhat are the challenges in delivering healthcare to the “everyone” which must include the socially disadvantaged, the economically challenged, and the systemically marginalized? What keeps us from reaching the “everywhere,” which must include the remote areas in our Himalayan region for instance, where until recently, essentials were airlifted by air force helicopters?.[4]\\n\\nWhile there are many challenges, I present five “A's” for our consideration:\\n\\nAwareness or the lack of it: How aware is the Indian population about important issues regarding their own health? Studies on awareness are many and diverse, but lacunae in awareness appear to cut across the lifespan in our country. Adequate knowledge regarding breastfeeding practice was found in only one-third of the antenatal mothers in two studies.[5,6] Moving ahead in the lifecycle, a study in urban Haryana found that only 11.3% of the adolescent girls studied knew correctly about key reproductive health issues.[7] A review article on geriatric morbidity found that 20.3% of participants were aware of common causes of prevalent illness and their prevention.[8]\\n\\nWhy is the level of health awareness low in the Indian population? The answers may lie in low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent on education within the healthcare system, and low priority for health in the population, among others.\\n\\nWhat is encouraging is that efforts to enhance awareness levels have generally shown promising results. For instance, a study in Bihar and Jharkhand demonstrated improved levels of awareness and perceptions about abortion following a behavioral change intervention.[9] A review on the effectiveness of interventions on adolescent reproductive health showed a considerable increase in the awareness levels of girls with regard to knowledge of health problems, environmental health, nutritional awareness, and reproductive and child health following intervention.[10]\\n\\nThe message is clear – we must strive to raise awareness in those whom we work with and must encourage the younger generation to believe in the power of education for behavior change.\\n\\nAccess or the lack of it: Access (to healthcare) is defined by the Oxford dictionary as “The right or opportunity to use or benefit from (healthcare)”[11] Again, when we look beyond the somewhat well-connected urban populations to the urban underprivileged, and to their rural counterparts, the question “What is the level of access of our population to healthcare of good quality?” is an extremely relevant one. A 2002 paper speaks of access being a complex concept and speaks of aspects of availability, supply, and utilization of healthcare services as being factors in determining access. Barriers to access in the financial, organizational, social, and cultural domains can limit the utilization of services, even in places where they are “available.”[12]\\n\\nPhysical reach is one of the basic determinants of access, defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work”[13] Using this definition, a study in India in 2012 found that in rural areas, only 37% of people were able to access IP facilities within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities[14] Krishna and Ananthapur, in their 2012 paper, postulate that in general, the more rustic (rural) one's existence – the further one lives from towns – the greater are the odds of disease, malnourishment, weakness, and premature death.[15]\\n\\nEven if a healthcare facility is physically accessible, what is the quality of care that it offers? Is that care continuously available? While the National (Rural) Health Mission has done much to improve the infrastructure in the Indian Government healthcare system, a 2012 study of six states in India revealed that many of the primary health centers (PHCs) lacked basic infrastructural facilities such as beds, wards, toilets, drinking water facility, clean labor rooms for delivery, and regular electricity.[14]\\n\\nAs thinkers in the disciplines of community medicine and public health, we must encourage discussion on the determinants of access to healthcare. We should identify and analyze possible barriers to access in the financial, geographic, social, and system-related domains, and do our best to get our students and peers thinking about the problem of access to good quality healthcare.\\n\\nAbsence or the humanpower crisis in healthcare: Any discussion on healthcare delivery should include arguably the most central of the characters involved – the human workforce. Do we have adequate numbers of personnel, are they appropriately trained, are they equitably deployed and is their morale in delivering the service reasonably high?\\n\\nA 2011 study estimated that India has roughly 20 health workers per 10,000 population, with allopathic doctors comprising 31% of the workforce, nurses and midwives 30%, pharmacists 11%, AYUSH practitioners 9%, and others 9%.[16] This workforce is not distributed optimally, with most preferring to work in areas where infrastructure and facilities for family life and growth are higher. In general, the poorer areas of Northern and Central India have lower densities of health workers compared to the Southern states.[17]\\n\\nWhile the private sector accounts for most of the health expenditures in the country, the state-run health sector still is the only option for much of the rural and peri-urban areas of the country. The lack of a qualified person at the point of delivery when a person has traveled a fair distance to reach is a big discouragement to the health-seeking behavior of the population. According to the rural health statistics of the Government of India (2015), about 10.4% of the sanctioned posts of auxiliary nurse midwives are vacant, which rises to 40.7% of the posts of male health workers. Twenty-seven percentage of doctor posts at PHCs were vacant, which is more than a quarter of the sanctioned posts.[18]\\n\\nConsidering that the private sector is the major player in healthcare service delivery, there have been many programs aiming to harness private expertise to provide public healthcare services. The latest is the new nationwide scheme proposed which accredits private providers to deliver services reimbursable by the Government. In an ideal world, this should result in the improvement of coverage levels, but does it represent a transfer of responsibility and an acknowledgment of the deficiencies of the public health system?\\n\\nAs trainers and educators in public health, how are we equipping our trainees to deliver a health service in the manner required, at the place where it is needed and at the time when it is essential? It is time for a policy on health human power to be articulated, which must outline measures to ensure that the last Indian is taken care of by a sensitive, trained, and competent healthcare worker.\\n\\nAffordability or the cost of healthcare: Quite simply, how costly is healthcare in India, and more importantly, how many can afford the cost of healthcare?\\n\\nIt is common knowledge that the private sector is the dominant player in the healthcare arena in India. Almost 75% of healthcare expenditure comes from the pockets of households, and catastrophic healthcare cost is an important cause of impoverishment.[19] Added to the problem is the lack of regulation in the private sector and the consequent variation in quality and costs of services.\\n\\nThe public sector offers healthcare at low or no cost but is perceived as being unreliable, of indifferent quality and generally is not the first choice, unless one cannot afford private care.\\n\\nThe solutions to the problem of affordability of healthcare lie in local and national initiatives. Nationally, the Government expenditure on health must urgently be scaled up, from <2% currently to at least 5%–6% of the gross domestic product in the short term.[20] This will translate into the much-needed infrastructure boost in the rural and marginalized areas and hopefully to better availability of healthcare– services, infrastructure, and personnel. The much-awaited national health insurance program should be carefully rolled out, ensuring that the smallest member of the target population is enrolled and understands what exactly the scheme means to her.\\n\\nLocally, a consciousness of cost needs to be built into the healthcare sector, from the smallest to the highest level. Wasteful expenditure, options which demand high spending, unnecessary use of tests, and procedures should be avoided. The average medical student is not exposed to issues of cost of care during the course. Exposing young minds to issues of economics of healthcare will hopefully bring in a realization of the enormity of the situation, and the need to address it in whatever way possible.\\n\\nAccountability or the lack of it: Being accountable has been defined as the procedures and processes by which one party justifies and takes responsibility for its activities.[21]\\n\\nIn the healthcare profession, it may be argued that we are responsible for a variety of people and constituencies. We are responsible to our clients primarily in delivering the service that is their due. Our employers presume that the standard of service that is expected will be delivered. Our peers and colleagues expect a code of conduct from us that will enable the profession to grow in harmony. Our family and friends have their own expectations of us, while our government and country have an expectation of us that we will contribute to the general good. A spiritual or religious dimension may also be considered, where we are accountable to the principles of our faith.\\n\\nIn the turbulent times that we live in, the relationships with all the constituents listed above have come under stress, with the client-provider axis being the most prominently affected. While unreasonable expectations may be at the bottom of much of the stress, it is time for the profession to recognize that the first step on the way forward is the recognition of the problem and its possible underlying causes. Ethics in healthcare should be a hotly discussed issue, within the profession, rather than outside it.\\n\\nCommunication is a key skill to be inculcated among the young professionals who will be the leaders of the profession tomorrow. As leaders in community medicine and public health, we may be the best placed to put this high up in the list of skills to be imparted. A good communicator is better placed to deal with the pressures of the relationships with client, employer, peer, colleague, family, friend, and government.\\n\\nThe five as presented above present challenges to the health of the public in our glorious country. As we get ready to face a future which is full of possibility and uncertainty in equal measure, let us recognize these and other challenges and prepare to meet them, remembering that the fight against ill health is the fight against all that is harmful to humanity.\\n\""

    "test_document=\"\"\"Fifteen years ago healthcare innovation became my field of work – first as a research program manager, more recently as Chief Technology Officer. \n",
    "A lot has changed in this time span.\n",
    "Philips has evolved from a diversified electronics conglomerate into a focused health technology company – focusing on precision diagnosis, image-guided therapy, connected care and personal health. But what’s more, the way we innovate today is very different from how we used to. \n",
    "Healthcare systems around the world are grappling with a rising demand for care, staff shortages and unsustainable costs. If we are to make healthcare more affordable, accessible and effective, old methods of innovation simply won’t suffice anymore. \n",
    "As I reflect back on the past 15 years, I see five ways in which healthcare innovation has evolved.\n",
    "Technology for healthcare innovation used to focus on product features – now it is about creating solutions for value-based care\n",
    " When I entered this field, innovation in medical technology was mainly about improving the features of systems and devices. \n",
    "For example, I vividly remember the ‘CT slice war’, when Philips and other manufacturers competed on quality of CT scans by increasing the number of cross-sectional images (or ‘slices’) of a particular part of the body. From 16, to 32, then 64 and upward. The goal was straightforward: improve image resolution. The radiologist would benefit by being better able to identify abnormalities in a patient’s body.\n",
    "The dynamics of healthcare innovation would soon get more complicated. In 2005, the North American Deficit Reduction Act sent a shock wave through the world of medical imaging. Many imaging procedures were hit by reimbursement cuts. In hindsight, this was a first sign of things to come: the economics of care would become much more important. Simply improving the resolution of a CT scan was not enough anymore. \n",
    "Today, we see a shift to value-based care – which is about delivering on the quadruple aim of achieving better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care.\n",
    "Product features are still important, but only as part of a broader solution. Fifteen years ago, we would go into a radiology department to showcase the performance and features of our latest scanner. These days a head of radiology may ask: how can you help my department become more efficient to meet growing patient demand?\n",
    "To answer questions such as this, innovation in healthcare needs to focus on integrated offerings of devices, software and services; moving from a product-centric to a solution-centric approach. \n",
    "For example, improving the efficiency of a radiology department may involve an analysis of equipment utilization and time it takes to read an image, benchmarking with other hospitals – using data to inform everyday decisions to boost quality and productivity.\n",
    "Measurable customer impact is now the yardstick for the success of an innovation. Or as our mantra has become: “It’s only a solution if it delivers on the customer’s KPIs.\"\"\"\n"
